# Maya's part:
#### Abstract
#### Intro
*Sentiment Analysis** is a technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. It involves analyzing text to classify it into categories like positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis helps understand how people feel about a particular topic or issue based on their written words.

**Why Use Sentiment Analysis in This Project:**

1. **Understand Public Opinion**: It helps gauge how people feel about the lockdown measures during COVID-19, whether they support or oppose them, and how their feelings change over time.

2. **Identify Key Issues**: By analyzing sentiments, we can identify common concerns or positive feedback about the lockdown, which can guide policymakers in making informed decisions.

3. **Track Changes Over Time**: Sentiment analysis can reveal how public opinion evolves with changing circumstances, such as new lockdown measures or updates on the pandemic.

4. **Enhance Communication**: Understanding public sentiment can help in crafting messages and policies that better address people's concerns and improve compliance with health guidelines.

5. **Support Decision-Making**: Insights from sentiment analysis can assist governments and organizations in evaluating the effectiveness of their communication strategies and public health measures.

In summary, sentiment analysis provides valuable insights into public perceptions and reactions, which is crucial for managing and improving responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
####Literature survey
####Objectives
### Planning and Preparation:
Forecasting helps individuals and organizations plan and prepare for future events. For example, predicting the number of COVID-19 cases can help hospitals prepare resources and allocate staff accordingly.

### Decision Making:
Accurate forecasts support better decision-making. Governments and health officials can make informed decisions about lockdowns, travel restrictions, and vaccination efforts based on predicted trends.

### Resource Allocation:
Forecasting helps in efficiently allocating resources. By predicting demand, resources like medical supplies, hospital beds, and financial support can be distributed where they are needed most.

### Risk Management:
Forecasting identifies potential risks and challenges, allowing for proactive measures. For instance, anticipating a surge in cases helps in managing healthcare system pressures and preventing overburden.

### Budgeting:
It aids in budgeting and financial planning by estimating future needs and costs. For businesses, forecasting sales trends can help in setting budgets and financial strategies.

### Strategic Planning:
Forecasting supports long-term strategic planning. Understanding potential future scenarios allows organizations to develop strategies and adapt to changing conditions.

### Public Awareness:
Forecasting provides valuable information to the public, helping them make informed choices and understand potential future developments.




#### Existing models
In 2020, when machine learning (ML) was newly applied to COVID-19 prediction, several specific problems with existing solutions were evident:

1. **Immaturity of ML Models**:
   - **Lack of Established Practices**: Many ML models for COVID-19 were new and untested, leading to uncertainty about their reliability and effectiveness.
   - **Limited Training Data**: Early models had limited historical data to train on, which impacted their ability to make accurate predictions.

2. **Data Collection Issues**:
   - **Inconsistent Data Reporting**: Different countries and regions reported data in varying formats and frequencies, making it difficult to create a unified dataset.
   - **Delayed Data Updates**: There were delays in the availability of data due to reporting lags and processing times.

3. **High Variability**:
   - **Rapidly Changing Virus Dynamics**: The virus's behavior and spread changed quickly, with new variants emerging and altering transmission patterns, complicating predictions.
   - **Evolving Public Response**: Changes in public behavior, such as adherence to lockdowns or social distancing, affected the accuracy of forecasts.

4. **Model Overfitting**:
   - **Overfitting to Early Data**: Some models performed well on early data but struggled to adapt to new trends or unexpected changes in the pandemic.

5. **Computational Constraints**:
   - **Resource Limitations**: High-complexity ML models required significant computational resources, which were sometimes unavailable or infeasible for rapid deployment.

6. **Lack of Real-time Integration**:
   - **Challenges in Real-time Data Integration**: Integrating real-time data into ML models was challenging, leading to outdated predictions or a lack of timely updates.

7. **Uncertainty and Risk Management**:
   - **Uncertain Parameters**: Early models faced uncertainty regarding parameters such as infection rates, transmission dynamics, and the impact of interventions.
   - **Lack of Standardization**: There was no standard approach to model evaluation, making it difficult to compare the effectiveness of different ML models.

8. **Public and Policy Misunderstandings**:
   - **Misinterpretation of Results**: Predictions were sometimes misinterpreted by the public or policymakers, leading to confusion or inappropriate responses.
   - **Transparency Issues**: Limited transparency in how ML models generated predictions sometimes undermined public trust.

These issues highlight the challenges faced in using ML for COVID-19 prediction during the early stages of the pandemic and underscore the importance of refining models, improving data quality, and enhancing communication.

#### Proposed System
#### Advantages of proposed system


**Advantages of the Project:**

1. **Understand Public Feelings**: Shows how people feel about the lockdown, whether they are happy or unhappy.

2. **Better Decision-Making**: Helps leaders make better choices by showing what people are concerned about.

3. **Improved Communication**: Helps in creating messages that better address public worries and needs.

4. **Evaluate Policies**: Assesses how well the lockdown measures are working based on public opinions.

5. **Track Changes**: Monitors how public opinion changes over time with new lockdown updates and news.

6. **Early Alerts**: Spots potential issues or negative trends early, so they can be addressed quickly.

7. **Engage the Public**: Strengthens the connection between authorities and people by understanding their feelings.

In short, the project helps understand public opinion, supports better decisions, and improves communication during the COVID-19 lockdown.

## Description of these



### Linear Regression (LR)
#### Definition: Linear Regression finds the best straight line that predicts an outcome based on one or more input variables.
Example: If you want to predict the number of new COVID-19 cases based on past data, Linear Regression will fit a line to the historical data points to estimate future cases.

### Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
#### Definition: LASSO is a type of regression that not only predicts outcomes but also selects the most important variables by reducing the impact of less important ones.
Example: To predict death rates, LASSO will use past data but focus on the most significant factors, such as age or underlying health conditions, and ignore less relevant ones.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
#### Definition: SVM finds the best boundary (or hyperplane) that separates different classes of data, often used for classification tasks.
 Example: To classify whether a region will have a high or low number of COVID-19 cases, SVM creates a boundary to distinguish between these categories based on factors like population density and previous case numbers.

### Exponential Smoothing (ES)
#### Definition: Exponential Smoothing gives more weight to recent observations to predict future values, making it good for time-series data.
Example: To forecast the number of recoveries over the next week, ES will focus more on recent recovery rates and use them to predict future recoveries, adjusting quickly to recent trends.
