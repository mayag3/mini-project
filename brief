# Algorithms used

1. Linear Regression (LR)
Definition: Linear Regression finds the best straight line that predicts an outcome based on one or more input variables.
Example: If you want to predict the number of new COVID-19 cases based on past data, Linear Regression will fit a line to the historical data points to estimate future cases.

2. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
Definition: LASSO is a type of regression that not only predicts outcomes but also selects the most important variables by reducing the impact of less important ones.
Example: To predict death rates, LASSO will use past data but focus on the most significant factors, such as age or underlying health conditions, and ignore less relevant ones.

 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Definition: SVM finds the best boundary (or hyperplane) that separates different classes of data, often used for classification tasks.
Example: To classify whether a region will have a high or low number of COVID-19 cases, SVM creates a boundary to distinguish between these categories based on factors like population density and previous case numbers.

 4. Exponential Smoothing (ES)
Definition: Exponential Smoothing gives more weight to recent observations to predict future values, making it good for time-series data.
Example: To forecast the number of recoveries over the next week, ES will focus more on recent recovery rates and use them to predict future recoveries, adjusting quickly to recent trends.
